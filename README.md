# MEDS-S1

**An open RISC-V SoC platform for accelerator research**
Maktab-e-Digital Systems (MEDS), UET Lahore · Apache-2.0

> **Status: Phase 0 — skeleton.** The specification set is complete, the repository structure and CI
> gate are in place, and the reference module and testbench are green. Most modules are still
> unwritten.

## What this is

MEDS-S1 is a RISC-V system-on-chip platform whose purpose is **to be attached to**. The scalar core
is deliberately conventional; the value is in the frozen attachment interfaces, the SoC generator,
the verification harness, the BSP, and the measurement infrastructure that makes every attached
accelerator's performance claim comparable to every other one's.

It exists to support MS and PhD work in **Edge AI** and **healthcare electronics** — so that a
thesis student's contribution is the accelerator and the measurement, not the plumbing.

| Component | What it is |
|---|---|
| **MEDS-S1** | the platform: SoC, generator, BSP, CI, board ports |
| **S1-Core** | the scalar RV64IMAC CPU inside it |
| **MEDS-V** | the RVV vector coprocessor ([separate repo](https://github.com/meds-uet/MEDS-V)), attached over MXIF |
| **MXIF** | the tightly-coupled extension interface; a profile of OpenHW CV-X-IF |
| **MEDS-X-\<name\>** | any accelerator built for MEDS-S1 |

## Quick start

```bash
make check-tools     # what you are missing
make ci              # structure + lint + unit tests  -- should be green
make help            # everything you can do
```

If `make ci` is green your environment works. If it is not, and the message does not tell you how to
fix it, that is our bug — open an issue labelled `type:docs`.

**New contributor?** → [`docs/guidelines/ONBOARDING.md`](docs/guidelines/ONBOARDING.md)
**About to write code?** → [`rtl/core/s1_alu.sv`](rtl/core/s1_alu.sv) and
[`verif/unit/tb_s1_alu.sv`](verif/unit/tb_s1_alu.sv) are the house style; copy their shape

## Repository layout

Every directory has a `README.md` saying what belongs there, what does not, how to add something,
and which catalogue projects land in it. If you are unsure where your code goes, that file answers it.

```
specs/          normative specification — the spec, interfaces, scope contract
rtl/            SystemVerilog: core, cache, fabric, peripherals, socket, common, generated
verif/          unit · cosim · riscof (ACT) · formal · conformance · common
sw/             bsp · apps · drivers
gen/            SoC generator: configs/*.yaml -> RTL, linker, headers, DTS
configs/        s1_nano · s1_base · s1_ai · s1_linux
boards/         one directory per board, exactly four files each
extensions/     custom ISA extensions + REGISTRY.md (opcode/CSR/accelerator IDs)
docs/           guidelines · modules · adr · reviews · figures
scripts/        build, checks, figure and document generation
```

## The document set

Read in this order.

| # | Document | What it answers | Audience |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | design_doc.md | the original strategic framing — **under progress**, not yet ready to publish | everyone |
| 2 | [specs/MEDS-S1-SPECIFICATION.md](specs/MEDS-S1-SPECIFICATION.md) | **the comprehensive spec** — architecture, block diagrams, accelerator integration, research methodology | all stakeholders |
| 3 | [specs/INTERFACES.md](specs/INTERFACES.md) | **normative** — MXIF, memory protocol, socket, RVFI, PMAs. The file that must not change. | implementers |
| 4 | [GITHUB_WORKFLOW.md](GITHUB_WORKFLOW.md) | repos, branches, issues, CI, reviews, releases | everyone |
| 5 | [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) | the short version of 4 and 6 | everyone |
| 6 | [docs/guidelines/](docs/guidelines/) | coding standard, verification guide, review checklist, onboarding | everyone writing code |
| 7 | [docs/adr/](docs/adr/) | why each irreversible decision was made | architects, reviewers |

### The specification as a PDF

[docs/MEDS-S1-Specification.pdf](docs/MEDS-S1-Specification.pdf) — typeset, with
purpose-drawn block, pin-out and timing diagrams plus some rendered flow and state diagrams. This is
the version to circulate for stakeholder review.

```
make docs        # figures + PDF
make figures     # regenerate docs/figures/*.svg only
make check-tools # verify pandoc / chrome / mmdc are present
```

**Every diagram is generated from code** ([scripts/gen_diagrams.py](scripts/gen_diagrams.py) on top
of [scripts/svgkit.py](scripts/svgkit.py)), so a design change is an edit to one file, not a hunt
through a drawing tool. Needs `python3`, `pandoc`, and Chrome/Chromium; `mmdc` is optional — without
it the mermaid diagrams are skipped and everything else still builds.

## Roadmap

| Phase | Deliverable | Exit criterion |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Specs frozen, CI green on an empty core | design review passed |
| 1 | S1-Core, CSR/traps, completion buffer, RVFI, co-simulation | RV64I arch-tests green vs Sail |
| 2 | Fabric, peripherals, generator, BSP, Verilator board | "Hello World" from C |
| 3 | Debug Module, DDR, caches, KC705 | **load and debug any ELF over JTAG, no resynthesis** |
| 4 | Accelerator socket, conformance TBs, MEDS-V adapter | **two accelerators attached by two people who did not write the core** |
| 5 | S-mode, Sv39, OpenSBI, Buildroot | shell prompt on the board |

Phase 3 is what unlocks the rest of the lab. Phase 4 is what proves this is a platform rather than a
processor.

**The CI gate is real and it applies to everyone:** `make ci` must be green, and nothing merges red.
