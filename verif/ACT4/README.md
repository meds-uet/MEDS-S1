# `verif/act4/` — Layer 3 — architectural compliance (ACT)

## What lives here
act4 configuration, the DUT and reference plugins, and the generated compliance reports.

## What does *not* live here
Hand-written ISA tests. Compliance tests come from `riscv-arch-test` upstream.

## How to add something
Sail is the reference. `make act4` runs the suite; the CI job is present and skipped until the plugin lands.

## Catalogue projects that land here
