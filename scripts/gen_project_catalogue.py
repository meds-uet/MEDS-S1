  <h3 class="s">How to state a preference</h3>
  <ul class="plain">
    <li>Send <b>three</b>, ranked, to your mentor. Mentors consolidate and pass to the graduate RAs.</li>
    <li>Give <b>one line of reasoning</b> per choice. Where two people want the same project, the
        reasoning decides it &mdash; so write it properly.</li>
    <li>A useful preference: <i>&ldquo;M-05, the PMA testbench. I want to learn how the memory map
        is enforced and I wrote SystemVerilog testbenches during training.&rdquo;</i></li>
    <li>A useless preference: <i>&ldquo;anything&rdquo;</i>, <i>&ldquo;whatever is easiest&rdquo;</i>,
        <i>&ldquo;the most impressive one&rdquo;</i>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="s">The contribution ladder</h3>
  <ul class="plain">
    <li><b>T0 &mdash; Contributor.</b> Add a peripheral via soc.yaml, write a driver, write a
        directed testbench, add a benchmark. Entry: rv-workshop completed.</li>
    <li><b>T1 &mdash; Implementer.</b> Implement a module against a frozen spec. Entry: two merged T0 PRs.</li>
    <li><b>T2 &mdash; Owner.</b> Own a module and its spec; review T1 work. Entry: one T1 module
        delivered <i>and verified</i>.</li>
    <li><b>T3 &mdash; Architect.</b> Own an interface. Only these people may change INTERFACES.md.</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="font-size:8.8pt;color:#495057;margin-top:1mm">
    Everyone starts at T0, including people who think they should not. The tiers are a ladder,
    not a label &mdash; a mentee who delivers M-05 well is a stronger candidate for a T-tier
    project next cycle than someone who was handed one this time.
  </p>

  <h3 class="s">How {nm} + {nt} + {nr} projects map onto the people we have</h3>
  <ul class="plain">
    <li><b>22 mentees, {nm} projects, teams of 1&ndash;2.</b> That absorbs everyone with room to
        spare, which is the point &mdash; preferences only mean something when there is genuine choice.</li>
    <li><b>8 mentors, {nt} projects.</b> Four mentors are committed to MEDS-V as their final year
        project, so expect three or four of these to be staffed this cycle and the rest to be
        queued or co-owned. Name the one you want anyway.</li>
    <li><b>3 graduate RAs, {nr} projects.</b> Clearly a menu rather than a roster. The P0 entries
        &mdash; R-01, R-04, R-05 and R-06 &mdash; start first, because Phase 1 does not begin
        without them.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="note" style="border-left-color:#E63946">
    <b>Two rules that are not negotiable.</b> Design review before RTL &mdash; a module owner
    presents the spec and the testbench plan, and the review approves the <i>spec</i>, not the
    code. And blockers are raised the same day: a mentee blocked for a week has lost a sixth of
    a semester.
