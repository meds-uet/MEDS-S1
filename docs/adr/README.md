# `docs/adr/` — Architecture decision records

## What lives here
One numbered, immutable record per significant decision: the context, the options weighed, the
decision, and the consequences we accepted.

## What does *not* live here
Specifications. An ADR records **why**; `specs/` records **what**. If you find yourself writing
signal names, you want `specs/INTERFACES.md`.

## How to add something
Copy `TEMPLATE.md`, take the next number, open a PR. ADRs are **never edited after acceptance** —
if a decision changes, write a new ADR and mark the old one *Superseded by ADR-NNNN*. The history is
the value: a contributor in 2031 needs to know what was considered and rejected, not just what won.
