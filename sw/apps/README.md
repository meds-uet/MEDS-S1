# `sw/apps/` — Applications and benchmarks

## What lives here
`hello`, the frozen benchmark suite, and the Edge-AI/healthcare reference workloads.

## What does *not* live here
Library code.

## How to add something
One directory per application with its own Makefile. Every benchmark ships a scalar C reference and expected output, or it cannot be a baseline.
